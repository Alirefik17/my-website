<div> I am a 15 year old born and raised in Edmonton. I went to a private school all my life until currently (grade 10).
 I have a family of 4, me , my older brother , my mom, and my dad. I am the youngest child.<br>
 I originate from Turkey, and have family living there. I also have family living in Calgary and Netherlands. We all visit each other whether it's that we go there or they come here.<br>
  When I was a kid me and my relatives were very close every week we went to each others houses and we always had fun together, whether it was a board game, electronics or just wrestling. I was also very close with my neighbors, we went on bike rides or just played street hockey.<br>
