<h1> My Hobbies </h1>
<h4>I have many hobbies, but first we will start off with sports. I love to play soccer, it is my favorite sport. I play for a club team called xtreame, I am the goalkeeper. I also love to play a variety of video games from the range of sports to fps games. My faviroute games to play are, Metal Gear Solid 5, UFC 2, NBA 2k, GTA5, Rocket Leauge, Uncharted, and Call of Duty.
  I love playing video games, but its a whole diffrent kind of thing when I play with my friends. We have much more fun playing together than we do when playing alone. I love to go on bikerides with my friends, we always have so much fun. After we usually grab a bite to eat while we are out together, all in all we all have fun and its good seeing each other.
